This script runs in QGIS

This takes in a DEM and other layers to automatically detect where there are waterfalls

It asks for a rainfall raster, to help understand where there would be more water, and therefore a better waterfall

It also asks for a road and a streams layer. These are used to estimate where there might be a culvert, allowing water to flow across the DEM in a realistic way, instead of getting stuck in table drains

This is only a new script, I haven't tested it much

Any issues let me know
